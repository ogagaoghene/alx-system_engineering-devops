## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What is a server
* Where servers usually live
* What is SSH
* How to create an SSH RSA key pair
* How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
* The advantage of using  #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash 

---

### [0. Use a private key](./0-use_a_private_key)
* Write a Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/holberton with the user ubuntu.


### [1. Create an SSH key pair](./1-create_ssh_key_pair)
* Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.


### [2. Client configuration file](./2-ssh_config)
* Your Ubuntu Vagrant machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, letâ€™s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password.
Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.


### [3. Let me in!](./4-puppet_ssh_config.pp)
* Now that you have successfully connected to your server, we would also like to join the party.
