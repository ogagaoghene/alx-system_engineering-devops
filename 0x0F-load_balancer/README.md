# 0x0F. Load balancer

## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

### [0. Double the number of webservers](./0-custom_http_response-header)
* In this first task you need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01 by using a bash script to automate the configuration of the web server. 


### [1. Install your load balancer](./1-install_load_balancer)
* Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.


### [2. Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet](./2-puppet_custom_http_response-header.pp)
* Just as in task #0, weâ€™d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.
